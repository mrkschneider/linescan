# linescan - fast character and newline search in buffers

## Summary
linescan allows to find locations of a specific character in a buffer until a newline is encountered. For example, this can be useful to find the locations of a delimiter character in a line read from a CSV file. Function implementations are in large parts derived from the GNU C library; therefore, this library is provided under the same license (GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1).
